# This publication contains two datasets originally from Opedals (2020) publication release "oysteiop/AlandInteractions: Publication release",
# used in Opedal et al. (2020)
# "Host-plant availability drives the spatiotemporal dynamics of interacting metapopulations across a fragmented landscape".
# The two datasets with this information is "testparse_12.csv", and "clustertest_40_5.csv". where the two removal methods are applied.
# Moreover, the datasets "patch_data.csv", "TotalPatchDat.csv" can also be gathered from the same publication release.
# 
# In "Metacomm_simulations_2025_aland.R" all of the code for the simulations can be found. It contains the baseline extinction calculations,
# funcions for the removal simulations, and graphs for results.
